# python-api-challenge
Here is my api-challenge. I used data pulled from the weather API on 11/18/2022. 


My code is within the code and data folder.
the cities data that I saved and based my observations on are within this folder as well.

You will find my observations for the weather.py directly below the charts in the jupyter notebook.

The charts are all saved under the images folder. I have only kept those I made labeled based on what aspect it represents.
The heatmap screenshot is also under the images folder.

In the vacation.py, I have two cells at the very bottom I'd like to keep, but I do ask you to ignore those cells.
